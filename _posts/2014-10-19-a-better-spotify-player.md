Are you sick of the standard Spotify player too? That it's hogging memory like crazy, the interface is bloated, becomes non-responsive and it lacks an equalizer?
Then you'd be please to know that there is an alternative, and pretty darn good one!

Meet Spotiamp (<a href="http://spotiamp.com" target="_blank">http://spotiamp.com</a>), a player able to play content from <a href="http://spotify.com" target="_blank">Spotify</a> Premium subscription, and looks and feels like an exact
copy of good old <a href="http://winamp.com" target="_blank">Winamp</a>; possibly some reverse engineering was performed? It's compatible with Winamp 2 skins,
and also Winamp visualization plugins. It is created as a side project by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludvig_Strigeus" target="_blank">Ludvig Strigeus</a>,
a renowned Swedish software developer also behind projects like Trac, ScummVM and more.

Make sure to check it out, you really won't regret it, if you're a Spotify user.

Now all there's really left to say is; "Winamp, Winamp, it really whips the Llama's ass!"

### UPDATE: 16-05-2015

Since Spotiamp's official website has been down for quite some time, I've decided to put up a mirror for it here: <a href="/assets/downloads/Spotiamp_0.2_Setup.exe">Mirror</a>.
