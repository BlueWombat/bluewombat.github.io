	My experience covers a great number of different technologies and projects, and the list is ever growing.
	I always strive to be the best that I can be, and then some, I hate compromising, though I from time to time have to because of deadlines, lack of allocated resources etc.
	I'm proud of what I do, I'm proud of what I've achieved, and hope to achieve a great deal more in the years to come; and as hinted above, I strive to deliver products I can be proud of, both in terms of functionality and feel, as well as in code design.

	<h2>Me outside work</h2>
	I'm a very down to earth person, humorous, and quite the conservationist. I dabble in photography, though as most amateurs I'm not all that great to be honest.
	I love listening to music, watching movies, going to concerts, and I'm a bit of a Hifi enthusiast. I'm also quite fond of red wine, so if you have a good bottle you'd like me to taste I rarely pass up the chance;-)
